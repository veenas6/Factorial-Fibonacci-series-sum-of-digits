# Recursive Functions in C

## Overview
This C program demonstrates the use of recursion to solve three common problems:

- Calculating the factorial of a number
- Finding the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
- Calculating the sum of digits of a number

## Features
- Uses recursion for elegant and concise implementation of each problem.
- Handles input validation for negative numbers where applicable.
- Outputs results for factorial, Fibonacci, and sum of digits based on user input.

## How to Use

### Compile the program
```bash
gcc -o recursion recursion.c
